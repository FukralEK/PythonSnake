# Python Snake

It's a simple Snake game created in Python using PyGame. Nothing special

# Wanna run it for some unknown reason?
Just install Python on your machine (if you haven't already).         

    
Then install PyGame using
```pip install pygame```    
and after just run the main script using
```python ./Snake.py```
